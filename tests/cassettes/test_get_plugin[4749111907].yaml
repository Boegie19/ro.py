      (formerly Roactify) is a collaborative project between @boatbomber and @csqrl,
      which converts Instances to code.\n\nWhether you work with vanilla Instances,
      or use a framework like Roact or Fusion, Codify has you covered! Roactify converts
      your current selection in Studio into a snippet that can be instantly plopped
      into your code.\n\nThis plugin requires web request permissions (for generating
      snippet data) and optional script injection permissions (for exporting snippets
      to your device).\n\nhttps://devforum.roblox.com/t/473076","commentsEnabled":false,"versionId":11886955700,"created":"2020-03-03T00:50:58.963Z","updated":"2022-05-08T17:23:56.693Z"}]}'
